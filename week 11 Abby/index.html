                <h3>Course Description</h3>
                <p>unit provides an introduction to the development of software in design and the creative industries. 
                It teaches an understanding of the fundamentals of computational thinking, as well as skills in the design and implementation of software for creative expression. 
                It introduces students to tools for building interactive design prototypes that express their interaction design skills through programming. 
                It covers knowledge of programming concepts, creative coding practices, and their practical implementation through Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
                Key concepts covered in this unit include: variables, functions, control flows, and algorithmic thinking. 
                Students learn how to approach creative expression through the medium of code, which will allow them to incorporate programming into their own design practice as well as to collaborate effectively with software developers. This unit is a foundational core unit in the Master of Interaction Design and Electronic Arts program.
